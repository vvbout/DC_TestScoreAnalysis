# DC_TestScoreAnalysis
A large school makes every student take year-end math, reading and writing exams.
There is a demand: to analyze score results, to prove if test preparation courses are helpful, to explore the effect of parental education level on test scores.

## Report summary
1. General score results:
* the scores proved that students can read better than write & calculate
* the MATH test showed the lowerest level of minimum, average & maximum scores
* ALL TESTS 25% of the students got scores up to 57 - 59
* ALL TESTS 50% of the students got scores up to 66 - 70
* ALL TESTS 75% of the students got scores up to 77 - 79
* ultimate score of 100 was achieved in every test
2. Effectiveness of the preparation course:
* in everage students who took the preparation course performed better
* minimum and mean scores for all tests are higher among those who completed
* in groups with scores over median those students who completed the course make the majority
3. Effect of parental education level:
* the results of the data analysis allow to make the conclusion that parental education level may have some impact on students test scores
* in average & in TOP performance groups trends have similar patterns
* students who's parents got masters degree have highest average scores
* bachelor's & associate's degrees go on the second place
* some college go third
* some high school group shows better results than high school in average
* high school overtake the some high school group in TOP performance segment
3. Insights from the TOP scores group study:
* there is strong positive correlation among score results in tests - if students achieve high scores, they achieve them in all 3 tests
* the profile of the student from the TOP score students group:
>
> "More often a girl (58.5%), probably taking the preparation course (51%), most probably taking lunch (76%), whose parents perhaps got some or associate's degree (25% + 25%), belonging to D or C race/ethnicity groups (30.5% = 28%)"
>
* for students in TOP performance group differences in mean scores among those who took the preparation corse and didn't are smaller than in average
* for the MATH test there is no difference at all
* girls perfom better in READING & WRITING
* boys perform better in MATH
* students who completed the preparation course achieve the ultimate score more often
* masters' degree is the sub group where the share of students who took the preparation course is the smallest comparing to other parents education levels
